This repository contains some data science projects in different areas that I have made.

## [Mexico Crop Yield Prediction](https://github.com/khadamich/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/mexico-crop-yield)

- In this project I developed a `Random Forest Regression` model in scikit-learn to predict the yearly crop yield for primary crops in Mexico.

## [Winning Space Race with Data Science](https://github.com/khadamich/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Winning-Space-Race-with-Data-Science-main)

- The final project of my IBM Data Science Professional Certificate in which I had to applied Machine Learning `Classification Models` to predict if the first stage of the Falcon9 rockets of SpaceX will land succesfully.

## [Magnesium](https://github.com/khadamich/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Magnesium)
- A freelance project I got in Upwork where a student want me to apply `Artifical Neural Networks` to predict the corrosion energy and the corrosion current for different compunds having Magnesium.
