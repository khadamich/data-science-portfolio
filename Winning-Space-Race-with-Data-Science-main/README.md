# Winnning Space Race with Data Science
This is final project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
## Asbstract
In this work Data Science Methodologies were used in order to implement Machine Learning Algorithms to the SpaceX Falcon-9 rocket data set with the purpose of predicting if the first stage of this rocket will land successfully. The Machine Learning models implemented achieved a mean accuracy of 0.84 over all the data set, whereas the mean Machine Learning models scores on test data obtained was 0.944.

## Motivation
The commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone and perhaps the most successful is SpaceX due this company can make rocket launches at relatively inexpensive prices.
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; while other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each. Much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost
of a launch.
