# Mexico Crop Yield Modeling
## Introduction
Agriculture feeds the global community. Discover whatâ€™s driving the production, trade, prices, and performance of corn, sugar, soybeans, pork, vegetable oils, and other food commodities, is one of the hottest topics in this area.

In this project I devoloped a Random Forest Regression model to predict the yearly crop yield of the primary crops in Mexico. To do this, I made usage of the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data) dataset to get the crop yield for every primary crop produced in Mexico between 1990 and 2021.
