# Mexico Crop Yield Modeling
## Introduction
Agriculture feeds the global community. Discover whatâ€™s driving the production, trade, prices, and performance of corn, sugar, soybeans, pork, vegetable oils, and other food commodities, is one of the hottest topics in this area.

In this project I devoloped a `Random Forest Regression` model to predict the yearly crop yield of the primary crops in Mexico. To do this, I made usage of the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data) dataset to get the crop yield for every primary crop produced in Mexico between 1990 and 2021, as well as the land usage and the pesticidades usage per crop area in the same period.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Here is a picture of the [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/nMt8RVmK9J4) in `Looker Studio` just to have a brief glance of the features and the behavior of the data.

The following figures are some examples of the plots I made with the [scripts](https://github.com/khadamich/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/mexico-crop-yield/src/visualization/visualize.py) in the [visualization](https://github.com/khadamich/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/mexico-crop-yield/src/visualization) section.
